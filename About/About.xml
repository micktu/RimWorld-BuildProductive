  <description>This convenient mod allows you to build by copying buildings you have already have, saving you a trip to the Architect tab. Simply select a building, click a button, and place.

It also copies settings for buildings that have some. Currently it remembers electrical &lt;b&gt;power switches&lt;/b&gt;, heater and cooler &lt;b&gt;target temperature&lt;/b&gt;, turret &lt;b&gt;hold-fire&lt;/b&gt;, and trap &lt;b&gt;auto-rearm&lt;/b&gt;. Ask me for more if you need it!

Some features planned, maybe. Some issues known, for sure.

Happy building!
